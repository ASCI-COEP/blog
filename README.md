# The Official ASCI-COEP Blog

Welcome to ASCI COEP's official blog! Submissions to this blog will direcly appear on our [blog website](https://asci-coep.github.io/blog/).

## How to submit blogs?

Congratulations on your resolve to write a blog. The first step is to choose an awesome topic and create an outline for your blog. Simultaneously, clone this repository.

The most common approach used is using Markdown, with your own customizations. How to do that? Take a look at these [instructions](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#customizing-blog-posts-with-front-matter) and our sample Markdown [post](https://asci-coep.github.io/blog/markdown/2020/01/14/test-markdown-post.html) with its [source](https://github.com/ASCI-COEP/blog/blob/master/_posts/2020-01-14-test-markdown-post.md). Links on instructions to create blogs using other methods is given at the bottom of this page.

When your markdown source is ready, name it in `YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md`, add your blog to `_posts` directory and submit a PR. It is as simple as that!

Make sure to add `author: "<a href='Link to your portfolio/GitHub/LinkedIn'>Your Name</a>"` in the front matter section of your blog.
